## FILE-HANDLING-UTILITY USING JAVA

### OBJECTIVE
The objective of this task is to build a **Java-based File Handling Utility** that demonstrates essential file operations, including writing, reading, and modifying (appending) text files. This utility should provide an **interactive menu-driven interface** that allows users to choose different file operations conveniently.

File handling is a fundamental concept in Java that enables programs to interact with external files for **data storage, retrieval, and modification**. It is widely used in real-world applications such as **logging, configuration management, report generation, and database integration**.

## Requirements

### 1️⃣ Write to a File
✅ Users should be able to enter text, which gets stored in a file.  
✅ If the file already exists, its content should be overwritten with the new input.  
✅ Use **FileWriter** and **BufferedWriter** to handle the writing operation efficiently.  

### 2️⃣ Read from a File
✅ The program should allow users to read and display the contents of a specified file.  
✅ If the file does not exist, an appropriate error message should be displayed.  
✅ Use **FileReader** and **BufferedReader** to read the file efficiently line by line.  

### 3️⃣ Modify (Append) a File
✅ Users should be able to add new content to an existing file without deleting its previous data.  
✅ The program should append the new input to the file instead of overwriting it.  
✅ Use **FileWriter** in **append mode (true)** to ensure existing content remains unchanged.  

### 4️⃣ User-Friendly Interface
✅ The program should provide a **menu-driven system** that allows users to navigate between different file operations easily.  
✅ **Error handling** should be implemented to manage cases like missing files, incorrect input, and I/O exceptions.

## Expected Deliverables
✔ A **functional Java program** implementing file handling operations.  
✔ Proper **documentation and comments** in the code to improve readability.  
✔ A **GitHub repository** containing the complete source code.  
✔ A well-structured **README file** that explains the program’s functionality, installation, and usage.  

---

## Technical Implementation
The program utilizes Java’s built-in **java.io** package, which provides various classes for handling files efficiently:

🔹 **FileWriter** – Writes characters to a file.  
🔹 **BufferedWriter** – Improves performance by buffering file write operations.  
🔹 **FileReader** – Reads characters from a file.  
🔹 **BufferedReader** – Reads text from a file efficiently, line by line.  

Additionally, **exception handling using try-with-resources** ensures proper resource management and prevents memory leaks.
